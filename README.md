Green Plant
Green Plant is an e-commerce website that sells plants online. Users can browse the available plants, add them to their cart, and place an order. Once an order is placed, it is notified to the admin for approval. After the admin approves the order, users can proceed with the payment through the payment gateway, which uses Razorpay for secure transactions.

On the admin side, the administrator can add plants under different categories, manage orders, and monitor all transactions made by users on the website. The admin has full access to maintain the inventory, approve or reject orders, and ensure that all transactions are processed smoothly.
